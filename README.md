# PasswordGenerator
Homework Assignment 3 due Wednesday, September 9, 2020 11:59 PM

In order to make the password generator I first worked on the script.js document. I knew that I had to pull the password from an array using a random number as the index, but I struggled to come up with a simple way to filter through each possible combination of characters that the user could choose. The homework assignment required the use of prompts, so I assigned variables with related prompts so that the user could pick their desired characters. Then, I created an if statement that encompasses all possible combinations of character choices. As I was making this, I knew that this couldn't possibly be the best solution.

After taking some time to think about better ways to do this, I came up with a concise way of filtering and wrote the simplescript.js document. In simplescript.js, instead of having a complicated if statement that goes over 100 lines, I just used four if statements that add characters to one array. I have included both documents, however simplescript.js is the one currently connected to index.html.
